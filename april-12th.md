after we defeated the boss (from April 25) we realize that there is now a bolder in our way and james was walking twordsa a wall so I decided to follow I see the guard while following apparentally he knows james I think "oh this is going to be fun" as I keep walking around he expains "I have a scrool for jullian that it says the church of the wind sept needs our assistance" we go to the airship and gets on we go to a cathedral with a lightning spirit and there was miss lady wind lady fire and lady light fighting we go and put a magical cube around them and then we keep trying to heal them and onagi gets hit from a mine from the minefield of explosions I decide to use my magical book to clear the landmines and then they all go basically using calming spells to calm everyone down succeeding with bartic of inspiration apparentally james has control over lady wind and told her to drop her sword we go around basically trying to get out and realize there was a invisible door for some strange reason I try to see if someone is really watching me so I look up thinking that there would be a giant orb above me from the weird orb wizzard so I try a test where I shove my middle finger into the air as a way for me to try and piss him off we get onto our ship and go home until we figured out we actually had to go to obsidian islan so thats where we went....
