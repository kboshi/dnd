I get out of bed with my crusty lab-coat get out of bed and rush out we decide to get onto a  boat and see why the crackhead magic guy decided to put me to sleep in a weird dream apparently he gives James a scroll with a meeting time and directions and his crystal ball forces water apparently and we go into the deeper city that's more grimey we move into a cave room with really small hallway I go forward with bob and see lady light in front off me in this wet cave we go along while people are dead and charged my new friend bob decides to loot some bodies while we go forward I see a monster and decide hey lets use my new magic and cast it on onagi to make her invisible and then after they do that they can sneak up on him and kill it and it failed spectacularly and so everyone else attacks and I decide to cast a wind spell and deplete a whole lot of health and then everyone else attacks and then jenova decides to cast what is basically a magic nuke when it has 10% hp and then kills the beast and almost kills all of us if it werent for lady light.
