	Death day last night I had a note saying that luthor wanted to kill all the personas 
	I walk outside and see luthor and I see margarita and a bunch of bugs and onagi started the fight wisdom crosser  and a big fight against apprentice and the beholder and luthor thanks to genova he defeated the bugs death to us all I guess
	and then there are two other beholders in front of us I cannot cast any magic because of the anti magic cone around us otherwise known as the beholders and then genova as always kills them.. we make our way to the docks we almost fight luthor they are taking them in and stealing them away I decide 0-kl;to argue with luthor and he makes me fall asleep I wake up and talk tentivally on how some of them did not do any har and he tells me that the personas wanted to go to the foundation I try to ask luthor to just erase margerita fromt he timeline and he says "no" because it would erace me from the timeline while we go the ship gets rocked around and I wake up and realize that it was all a dream for four days.... note to myself to murder the magical orb man who apparentally put me under sleep and now the only thing I want is to break a magical orb and I hear a magical ticking sound from lady light
