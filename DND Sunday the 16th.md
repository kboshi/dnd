I wake up from my bed and just lay there for a bit until genisis wanted me out and about and so off I go to see my version of "the wizzard of oz" echo....  I see james trading so I wait and then for some apparent weird reason they bring out a testing dummy while talking about crystals and then I start talking about how I may have broken my soul orb they all look fazed onagi sees something wrong with me and backs up and lady light keeps messing with echos hair and genova tries to persuade lady light into telling us about the orbs then we go into a fight and right now echo is overwhelmed I basically just start talking intelligently like I do and say what is the best thing to do and then the conflict ends then we go back to the house to actually talk about the broken soul orb apparentally its the soul of whomever gave it to you and since its broken luthor is not dead so now we have a orb thats either lady wind or the other green aurad one and then all the sudden echo colapses she gets revived from lady light
