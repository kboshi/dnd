I wake up and hear James say the one word that can actually wake me up the word breakfast..... nothing can make me hungrier I get my lab coat on and get ready to go on a adventure we run into a wraith that was nice he did not get angry for me bumping into him and well we hear the (wizard that I forgot the name of) say some stuff but I was tired of the bs so I decided to just look up and middle finger him.. and got struck by lightning.... and went unconscious the last thought I had was well fuck my life.... I wake up with genesis on me healing me I hear James basically say to not mess with Julian because he will "mess us up" we decide to go to breakfast finally and sit at the table and find 6858 sitting on the table we talk the meal was great and seemed to make my magic better I hear that there is a shop at the first floor so we go down and apparentally there is a artificer shop I magify my bow and leave twords the park and see the meth wizard I reach out with my magical hand and it failed because behind me there was a beholder... we decided to do nothing and talk it out apparentally there is a town that is being attacked so we gho out to the city to stock up on supplies before we go I meet luthor and he puts his hand in my mouth
